🩺 MediAI – Your AI-Powered Smart Health Companion
MediAI is built for people like us – those who get health checkups but rarely understand the reports, forget to follow up, or just want instant, reliable health insights without spiraling into WebMD doom.
We created MediAI to be your virtual health buddy – analyzing your reports, predicting health risks, answering medical questions, and helping you stay on top of your well-being.

🚀 What Can MediAI Do?
🧾 Explain Your Reports Like a Doctor Would
Upload any diagnostic report (like a blood test), and MediAI breaks it down in simple language – no medical degree needed.

🧠 Predict Health Risks Early
Using AI, MediAI spots potential health issues before they become serious – based on your symptoms, reports, and patterns.

💬 Ask It Anything (Seriously)
Our hybrid chatbot (powered by Ollama + Hugging Face) gives smart, personalized, and trustworthy answers to all your health questions.

🧘 Stay on Track
With reminders for medication, checkups, and lifestyle changes – MediAI nudges you just like a caring family member would.

📂 Keep All Records in One Place
Forget the paper mess. Upload, store, and instantly access your reports – even generate a QR code for emergencies.

🙌 Why We Built This
Health should be proactive, not reactive.
We built MediAI for anyone who’s ever looked at a lab report and thought “Okay… but what does this even mean?”
It’s time to make healthcare more understandable, accessible, and AI-smart – without replacing doctors, but by making their advice more reachable.
